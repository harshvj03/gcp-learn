ADO.net entity frame 
Work with relational data as domain specific objects, Eliminating the need for most of the data access plumbing code that developer usually need to write.
using the entity framework, developer still queries using linq, than retrieve and manipulate data as strongly typed objects.
Entity framework is an enhancement to ado.net that gives developers an automated mechanism for accessing and storing the data in a database.
Entity framework supports three different development approached to use entity framework in a application :
1). Code first
2). Model First 
3). Database first

DbContext is the primary class that is responsible for interacting with data as objects. DbContext is responsible for the following activities: 
1). Entity Set: contains entity set for all the entities which are mapped to db tables.
2). Querying : DbContext converts linq queries to sql queries and send it to the databases.
3). Change tracking: it keeps track of changes, that occured in the entities after it has been queries from the database.
4). Persisting Data: DbContext performs the insert, update and delete operations to the database based on the entities state.
5). Manage relationships: 
6). Object Something : DbContext converts the table data into entity objects.
